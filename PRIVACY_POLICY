This Chrome extension does not collect any user data.

This extension only uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve and display
information about the playlist you are currently viewing in browser whether
public or private.

This extension also caches certain information. The channel and title filters
that the user enters are stored with Google using Chrome sync in order for the
extension to use the same filter as the user did last time then did a search on
that playlist across their logged in devices.

This extension also caches a list of the videos in the playlist locally on the
user's device only for easier and faster retrieval for the extension.
